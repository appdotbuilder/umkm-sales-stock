    // 1. Query all products from products table
    // 2. Join with sales_transaction_items to calculate sales statistics
    // 3. Calculate total_sold (sum of quantities) and total_revenue (sum of subtotals)
    // 4. Handle products with no sales (0 values)
    // 5. Order by total_revenue DESC to show best performing products first
