export async function deleteProduct(id: number): Promise<{ success: boolean }> {
    // This is a placeholder declaration! Real code should be implemented here.
    // The goal of this handler is deleting a product from the database.
    // Steps to implement:
    // 1. Check if product exists and has no associated sales transactions
    // 2. If product has sales history, mark as inactive instead of deleting
    // 3. Delete the product from products table using drizzle
    // 4. Return success status
    // 5. Throw error if product not found or has associated transactions
